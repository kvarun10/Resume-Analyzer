I would rate this resume a 6 out of 10.\n\n2. The reason for this rating is that the resume is organized well but lacks specific details about the candidate's projects, internships, and work experiences. It also lacks a professional summary or objective, which is crucial for conveying the candidate's career goals and motivation. Additionally, the resume could benefit from more bullet points and action verbs to make the achievements and responsibilities more impactful.\n\n3. Here are 2-3 improvements:\n\n   a. Add a professional summary or objective that succinctly explains the candidate's career goals and the skills they bring to the table.\n\n   b. Provide more specific details about the candidate's projects, internships, and work experiences. Instead of listing the technical skills and languages they know, describe how they have applied them in real-world projects or work experiences.\n\n   c. Use action verbs throughout the resume to make the achievements and responsibilities more impactful. For example, instead of saying \"Member, Darpan Dramatics Committee\", say \" Led and organized theatrical events as a member of the Darpan Dramatics Committee\". Similarly, instead of saying \"1st Position Culrav 2k24, Monologue Act\", say \"Received first place in the Monologue Act competition during Culrav 2k24\"."
